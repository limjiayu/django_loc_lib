"""locallibrary URL Configuration

The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/http/urls/
Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))
"""
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]

# Use include() to add paths from the catalog application 
from django.urls import include

# whenever a URL that starts with catalog/ is received, 
# catalog.urls will process remaining substring
# when django returns import function (django.urls.include())
# splits URL string at designated end character, sends remaining substring to URLconfmodule for further processing
urlpatterns += [
    path('catalog/', include('catalog.urls')),
    
]
# path() that forwards requests with pattern 'catalog' to the module 'catalog.urls'

#Add URL maps to redirect the base URL to our application
from django.views.generic import RedirectView
urlpatterns += [
    path('', RedirectView.as_view(url='catalog/', permanent=True)),
]
# redirecting root URL of our site (127.0.0.1:8000) to URL 127.0.0.1:8000/catalog/
# application used for our project
# url pattern to specified in path() is matched
# leave the first parameter empty

# Use static() to add url mapping to serve static files during development (only)
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns += static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)

#Add Django site authentication urls (for login, logout, password management)
